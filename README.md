Project: SFO Air Traffic Landings Statistics – Alteryx Data Profiling & Transformation 

This project focuses on data preparation, profiling, and transformation using Alteryx Designer and Azure SQL Database.
Below are the key components of the workflow and tasks completed:

🔹 Database Setup

Created a SQL Server / Azure SQL Database named DAMG7370FALL2025.

Created a user damg7370 and granted db_owner privileges for full database access.

🔹 Data Analysis & Profiling (Alteryx)

Imported SFO Air Traffic Landings Statistics dataset (CSV format).

Performed data profiling to assess field health — missing values, uniqueness, ranges, and data types.

Applied Auto Field tool to optimize column data types and validated the selected types.

🔹 Data Transformation

Converted Activity Period field from string to a proper Date format.

Converted date_as_of and data_loaded_at fields from PST to GMT timezone.

Created metadata fields:

DI_Created_By – captures system user name via GetEnvironmentVariable("USERNAME").

DI_Created_Dt – captures current system date/time converted to GMT using DateTimeToUTC(DateTimeNow()).

Sequence ID – generated with Record ID tool, positioned as the first column.

Used Select / Dynamic Rename tools to rename all fields into database-friendly formats (no spaces or special characters).

🔹 Data Validation

Cross-checked all columns against the DataSF Data Dictionary bounds.

Filtered out records violating catalog metadata or value constraints.

Retained only valid rows for the final output dataset.

🔹 Deliverables

.yxmd – Alteryx workflow file

Final cleaned and validated CSV output

Invalid rows (separate CSV for reference)
